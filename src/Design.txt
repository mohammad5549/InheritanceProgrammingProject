Level 1 : Physical Hard Drive - name, size (GB)

Level 2 : Physical Volume - Factors: (1 physical hard drive, user provided name, UUID).
                            Condition :(Only created with hard drive).
                            Extra Information: Can be added to Volume Groups (Level 3). A 1 to 1 ratio with physical
                            hard drive, a physical hard drive can only belong to 1 physical vol.

Level 3: Volume Groups - Factors: (User provided name, UUID)
                         Consists : (Consists of a list of Physical Volumes(Level 2), and a list of
                         Logical Volumes(Level 4)
                         Return Values : the size of the Volume Group after adding up all Physical Volumes
                                       : the size left of the Volume group after subtracting each Logical Volume

Level 4: Logical Volumes: Factors: (User provided name, UUID, an associated volume group)
                          Condition: CANNOT exist without an associated volume group
                                     Should not be able to create a Logical Volume without enough space.

Classes:
PhysicalDrive
    Variables : String Name, int Size, PhysicalVolume PV (associated with Physical Volumes)
    Constructor: public PhysicalDrive(String name, int Size)
    Methods: Get Methods for each variable
             1 Set method for the PhysicalVolume to set the associated PhysicalVolume

Superclass LVMSYSTEM
       This is the Superclass or the Parent Class for PhysicalVolume, VolumeGroup, and LogicalVolume as these three
       classes all require a name as well as a UUID
       Variables : String Name, UUID UUID
       Super Constructor : (String Name)
            -Within this constructor, when called a random UUID would be generated
       Methods: Get Methods for both variables so that the sub/child classes could access their appropriate name and UUID
       information

PhysicalVolume
    Variables : PhysicalDrive physicalDrive, VolumeGroup volumeGroup. A Physical Volume has a Physical Drive and is within
                a VolumeGroup
    Constructor : (String Name, PhysicalDrive physicalDrive)
    Methods: Get methods for both variables
             1 Set method for Volume Group to set the associated Volume Group

VolumeGroup
    Variables : ArrayList PhysicalVolume PV - Stores all the Physical Volumes it contains
                ArrayList LogicalVolume LV - Stores all the Logical Volumes it contains
                int totalSize (The size that the Volume Group has from the Physical Volumes)
                int availableSize   (The size that is available after Logical Volumes are created)

    Constructor : (String Name, PhysicalVolume PV)
                - Adds the PhysicalVolume to the PV ArrayList
                - Sets the total and available size to the Physical Drive associated with the Physical Volume

    Methods : Get Methods for all variables including the ArrayLists
              2 methods, 1 for adding Physical Volumes which increases the total size as well as increases the available
              size, and another for adding Logical Volumes which decreases the available size

LogicalVolume
    Variables : int size
    Constructor : (String name,int size)
    Methods : 1 method to return the value of size:

Logic
    This class contains all the logic behind the LVM simulation
    Variables -ArrayList PhysicalDrive PHDlist - contains all the Physical Drives created
               ArrayList PhysicalVolume PVlist - contains all the Physical Volumes created
               ArrayList LogicalVolume LVlist - contains all the Logical Volumes created
               ArrayList VolumeGroup VGlist - contains all the Volume Groups created

    Methods : Runner - takes String input as a parameter and checks the command that the user has entered and will
                       run the method according to the command

              installDrives - takes the user input, checks the required conditions and enters the information accordingly,
                              creating Physical Drives and adding them to the PHDList

              listDrives - lists all the Physical Drives created in PHDlist

              pvcreate - takes the user input, checks the required conditions, creates Physical Volumes and adds them to
                         the PVlist

              pvlist - list out all the Physical Volumes along with their information in PVList

              lvcreate - takes the user input, checks the required conditions, creates Logical Volumes and adds them to
                         the LVlist

              lvlist - lists out all the Logical Volumes in LVlist along with their information

              vgcreate - takes the user input, checks the required conditions, and creates a Volume Group and adds it to the
                        VGlist

              vgextend - takes the user input, checks the required conditions, and allows the user to add a physical volume
                         onto an already existing Volume Group. Adds the Physical Volume to the Volume Groups ArrayList
                         of Physical Volumes

              vglist - lists out all the Volume Groups in VGlist along with their information.

Main
    The main class is the runner class
    Contains no variables or methods
    Creates an empty logic object in order to access all the methods within the logic class
    Creates a scanner object to allow user input for commands
    Creates a loop that would run until the word exit is inputted by the user that allows all the commands to be accessed
    by the user
